    <h1 class='hello-world'>What would you like to know about VR?</h1>
    <p>The concept of Virtual Reality is mind blowing aloowing the user to view a different world.
      The head sets create a visual field of 114 degrees that is equivalent to the human FOV.
      The system running the game is providing two full rendered 1080p 60fps seamless gameplay.
      While this is a beautiful technological advancement it comes with a price tag. The origional
      headsets were $600-800 for the setup not including a $1000+ gaming desktop.
